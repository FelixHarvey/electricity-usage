                The choropleth compares SA2 regions (suburb or a few suburbs combined). 
                Simply scroll on the map to zoom in and out of your area of choice. 
                Hovering over a region will display the relevant details for that region. 
                Electricity usage can be filtered by using the percentiles slider.
                The metric can be changed from the control panel, the two options are median electricity usage and emissions.
                Emissions is calculated by multiplying the electricity usage by a state estimate for emissions intensity.
                <br>
                <br>
                The electricity generation area chart can be changed by using the controls or alternatively clicking on a region in an appropriate state.
                Hover over the area chart to see the composition of electricity generation in that state at that particular time.
                The legend can also be used to highlight individual generation sources for that state.

              <h4 class="mt-3">Electricity - Environmental Impacts</h4>
              <p class="lead">
                Energy and electricity production is the primary source of greenhouse gas emissions (33% of emissions) within Australia and therefore contributes heavily to the issue of climate change within Australia.
                Climate change has numerous flow on effects which directly impact the sustainability of this planet.
                Electricity is of paramount importance because it can be produced sustainability through renewable energy and therefore has little to no ongoing emissions.

                To find out how you can ensure your electricity provider sources from renewable sources see the <a href="https://www.greenelectricityguide.org.au/">Green Electricity Guide</a> and <a href="https://www.choice.com.au/home-improvement/energy-saving/reducing-your-carbon-footprint/articles/green-electricity-review">Choice</a>.
                It is also worth looking into getting rooftop solar installed to reduce costs and emissions, see <a href="https://www.energy.gov.au/households/solar-pv-and-batteries">energy.gov.au</a>.
